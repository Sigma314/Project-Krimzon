This is Project Krimzon. It's a working title, but It's the best thing I got so far. 
Project Krimzon is a fan-made project set in the "future" era of the Jak and Daxter 
universe. The game is taking a "Star Wars Battlefront" approach to the series, where
you control the troops on the ground to organize massive battles and crush anyone 
who gets in your way.

We have an inexperienced lead dev, (that being me, Philip) an amazing AI programmer,
(This guy, Spencer) a man who knows what he's doing when it comes to music, (Tsayn) 
a guy who knows a lot about gameplay balance, making sure nothing is overpowered, 
(Mosher) a handfull of testers, and a few voice actors. (We need more of them) As 
you can see, not a great team.

What we need is help. Lots of it. well, not We, per sey. /I/ do. Becuase Spencer 
is just doing AI and Tsayn is just doing Music. I'm doing everything else. This 
is not what I want. What I want is to be able to either learn how to do the things
required to make a kickass title or to get some people who know how to. As it stands
now, I'm barely able to open an OpenGL context.
